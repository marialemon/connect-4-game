# Connect 4

## Some Requirements:

- 7x6 board (7 on the "x" axis and 6 on the "y" axis).
- Red and yellow pieces. The first game is always started by Red (the second by Yellow, the third by Red...).
- There is no functionality to be implemented that allows you to play against the App. It is assumed that two real people will play alternately.
- When the column is selected, the piece is placed at the bottom of the column.
- Save the number of games won for each team as long as the App is not terminated.
- Two buttons, one to restart the game and the other one to reset the win/loss counter.
